# Google Books CLI API App

A command line application built using Node.js and npm (node package manager).

## How to use

`git clone` this repository and run `npm install` to download the node package manager dependencies.

`node index.js` will run this app. Follow the prompt to query for a book by entering its name.

## MVP (minimum viable product)

This application connects to the Google Books API (application programming interface) to display a list of 5 books.

Books, or volumes, should be displayed to include the author, title, and publishing company.

Upon query, users can select 1 of the 5 volumes displayed."

Finally, a user can view their reading list.
